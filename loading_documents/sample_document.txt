Introduction
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.

Architecture
The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the Architecture page.

langchain-core: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.
Integration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
langchain-community: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
langgraph: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features. See LangGraph documentation.
